This summarizes the US nuclear capabilities in the event of an attack. How much is correct? Who knows. The information is all over the place and I wanted to centralize some of it for myself.

## Early Warning and Control

The Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) system is an airborne radar picket system for detecting aircraft, ships, and vehicles and perform Command and Control (C2) of the battlespace. Modern AEW&Cs can detect aircraft from up to 400km away, and one flying at 9km altitude can cover an area of 312,000 km2. Three such aircraft in overlapping orbits can cover the whole of Central Europe. For the US Navy, the E-2 Hawkeye is used to protect its supercarriers and to augment their onboard Command Information Centers (CICs). The US Airforce (USAF) E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWAC) replaced the EC-121 Warning Star first flown in 1949. Historically, the E-3 has been deployed during Operation Desert Shield (1990-08-02 - 1991-01-17, the first part of the Gulf War 1990-08-02 - 1991-02-28) and Operation Desert Storm (1991-01-17 - 1991-02-28, second part of the Gulf War) to defend against Iraqi forces, flying 379 missions. They have been deployed extensively since.

All working together to support the E-6B ALCS and LGM-30G Minutemen III ICBMs as part of the USAF nuclear arsenal, in conjunction with the rest of the Eigth Air force (bombers).


## US Navy arm of the Triad

The operating forces of the US Navy consists of nine components:

* United States Fleet Forces Command (USFF) -- part of USNORTHCOM
* United States Pacific Fleet (USPACFLT) -- part of USINDOPACOM
* United States Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT) -- part of USCENTCOM
* United States Naval Forces Southern Command (USNAVSO) -- part of USSOUTHCOM
* United States Naval Forces Europe-Africa (CNE-CNA) -- part of EUCOM and USAFRICOM
* United States Fleet Cyber Command -- part of USSPACECOM
* United States Navy Reserve (USNR)
* United States Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWARCOM) -- part of USSOCOM
* Operational Test and Evaluation Force (OPTEVFOR) -- part of Office of the Chief of Naval Operations

The US Navy submarine capability consists of three types: ballistic missile (SSB and SSBN), attack submarines (SSN and SSK), and cruise missile submarines (SSG and SSGN). The N at the tail end of the hull classification designates that it is nuclear powered and the K for diesel-electric.

Attack submarines are designed for hunting and killing other submarines, surface ships, and merchant ships. The USN classes for this type are Los Angeles Class (SSN 688), Seawolf Class (SSN 21), and Virginia Class. Los Angeles Class have 4 torpedo tubes with 37 Mk48 torpedos, Mk67 and Mk60 CAPTOR mines, and have the capability to launch UGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles from 12 vertical launching systems (VLS) and UGM-84 Harpoon missiles from the torpedo tubes. As of present there are 31 Flight I, 8 Flight II with VLS, and 23 Flight III 688i 688 class submarines. They use hull numbers 688-773 with Flight I using 688-718, Flight II 719-750, and Flight III 751-773. Seawolf Class are larger, faster, quieter, and have more weapons than the Los Angeles Class. They have the capability to carry up to 50 UGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles with 8 torpedo tubes for launching. The Seawolf subgroup consists of SSN 21-22, and the Jimmy Carter subgroup consists of SSN-23. Virginia Class are due to replace the Los Angeles Class submarines with the capability to carry up to 65 UGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and have 12 VLS and 4 torpedo tubes. Block I consists of SSN 774-777, Block II 778-783, Block III 784-791, Block IV 792-801, and Block V 802-811. 

Cruise missile submarines launch submarine launched crew missiles (SLCMs) and anti-ship missiles. Cruise missiles are guided missiles that remain in the atmosphere for large portions of their flight at approximately constant (cruise) speed. 4 Ohio Class submarines were converted from SSBNs to SSGNs. The SSGNs have SSN 726-729.

Ballistic missile submarines launch submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) with nuclear warheads. The rest of the Ohio Class submarines are SSBNs with SSN 730-743. These vessels are:

* USS Henry M. Jackson (SSBN-730) -- WA
    * Mk48 torpedoes, 24 Trident II D-5 SLBMs
* USS Alabama (SSNB-731) -- WA
    * Mk48 torpedoes, 24 Tident II D-5 SLBMs
* USS Alaska (SSBN-732) -- GA
    * Mk48 torpedoes, 24 Trident II D-5 SLBMs
* USS Nevada (SSBN-733) -- WA
    * Mk48 torpedoes, 24 Trident II D-5 SLBMs
* USS Tennessee (SSBN-734) -- GA 
    * Mk48 torpedoes, 24 Trident II D-5 SLBMs
* USS Pennsylvania (SSBN-735) -- WA
    * Mk48 torpedoes, 24 Trident II D-5 SLBMs
* USS West Virginia (SSBN-736) -- GA
    * Mk48 torpedoes, 24 Trident II D-5 SLBMs
* USS Kentucky (SSBN-737) -- WA
    * Mk48 torpedoes, 24 Trident II D-5 SLBMs
* USS Maryland (SSBN-738) -- GA
    * Mk48 torpedoes, 24 Trident II D-5 SLBMs
* USS Nebraska (SSBN-739) -- WA
    * Mk48 torpedoes, 24 Trident II D-5 SLBMs
* USS Rhode Island (SSBN-740) -- GA
    * Mk48 torpedoes, 24 Trident II D-5 SLBMs
* USS Maine (SSBN-741) -- WA
    * Mk48 torpedoes, 24 Trident II D-5 SLBMs
* USS Wyoming (SSBN-742) -- GA
    * Mk48 torpedoes, 24 Trident II D-5 SLBMs
* USS Louisiana (SSBN-743) -- WA
    * Mk48 torpedos, 24 Trident II D-5 SLBMs

The vessels at Naval Base Kitsap, Washington are operated by the USPACFLT, and the ones at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia are operated by the USFF.

These 14 vessels constitute the US Navy arm of the nuclear triad. These submarines can hide from reconnaissance satellites and launch their weapons with virtual impunity. As such, they are immune to a first strike. They also allow for the possibility of a decapitation strike, aimed at removing the leadership or C2 of the enemy, as they can sneak up close to the enemy coast and launch a missile on a non-optimal ballistic trajectory allowing for a faster and lower path.

## In the case of war

Take Charge And Move Out (TACAMO) is a system of links used to maintain communication between the National Command Authority (NCA) and the nuclear triad. NCA is the source of lawful military orders and comprises POTUS and SECDEF, or VPOTUS and DEPSECDEF. TACAMO primarily serves as a signals relay, where it receives orders from a command plane such as Operation Looking Glass Airborne Command Post (ABNCP), verifies, and retransmits their Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) to US strategic forces. TACAMO consists of an airborne portion with the US Navy Strategic Communications Wing One (STRATCOMWING 1) which houses the VQ-3 Ironmen, VQ-4 Shadows and VQ-7. The former two operate E-6Bs which are equipped with Airborne Launch Control Systems (ALCS).

The USAF E-6 Mercury is an aircraft based on the Boeing 707, replacing the EC-130Q (based on the C-130 Hercules). They are painted anti-flash white to reflect some of the thermal radiation from a nuclear explosion. The E-6A entered service with VQ-3 on 1989-08-03, and VQ-4 on 1991-01. The E-6B is an upgrade to the E-6A, with all 16 modified to the E-6B by 2006-12-01.

The USAF E-4 Advanced Airborne Command Post (AACP), Nightwatch, are modified Boeing 747-200Bs for the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP), acting as a survivable mobile command post for the NCA, namely for POTUS. The 4 E-4Bs are operated by the 1st Airborne Command and Control Squadron of the 595th Command and Control Group, part of the Air Force Global Strike Commmand (AFGSC), a MAJCOM of the USAF. 

Today, at least one USSTRATCOM ABNCP is on alert around the clock, postured with a full USSTRATCOM battlestaff and ALCS crew to perform the Looking Glass mission in the event the USSTRATCOM Global operations Center (GOC) is incapacitated. This battlestaff and crew consists of

* an air crew
* a Communications Systems Officer and team
* an Airborne Emergency Action Officer
* a Mission Commander
* a Strike Advisor
* an ALCS/Intelligence Officer
* a Meteorological Effects Officer
* a Logistics Officer
* a Force Status Controller
* an Emergency Actions NCO

The ALCS provides launch capability for the LGM-30G Minutemen III Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), and the EAM is used to communicate to the rest of the triad. For nuclear submarines running at depth, the E-6B extends a two and a half mile long trailing wire antenna (TWA) for use with the Survivable Low Frequency Communications System (SLFCS).

## Execution

The old Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) existed from 1961 to 2003 as the general plan for nuclear war. Since 2012 this has been replaced by the OPLAN 8010-12. The SIOP would be executed by POTUS as a member of the NCA, and the release of the weapons is goverened by the two-man rule (requires two authorized people). For ICBMs there are various safeguards: both operators must agree that it is a valid authorization code against a sealed authenticator which are stored in a safe with two separate locks, with each operator having only one key. Once the order is verified, they insert the keys into slots on the control panel and turn them simultaneously, far enough apart so no single person can complete the action. The crew at another missile launch control center must do the same for a launch. For SLBMs, both the Commanding Officer (CO) and Executive Officer (XO) must agree that it is a valid authorization code and then mutually authorize the launch. The weapons officer must also confirm the launch. As for the ICBMs, each only has access to one key for one lock with nobody having access to all keys. The unlock key for a combination lock comes as part of the launch order (EAM).

If the NCA (POTUS + SECDEF) decide to launch nuclear weapons -> passed to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), advisor to POTUS, National Security Council (NSC), Homeland Security Council (HSC), and SECDEF -> through to National Military Command Center (NMCC) via the Presidental Emergency Satchel holding the authentication codes (gold codes). These codes (and the satchel) are also assigned to the VP, and generated daily by the National Security Agency (NSA) to the White House, Pentagon, USSTRATCOM, and TACAMO.The codes contain attack options which include major attack options (MAOs), selected attack options (SAOs), and limited attack options (LAOs). Once the attack is selected, that and the gold codes are transmitted to the NMCC. -> once the presidents identity has been verified by the CJCS or the senior officer in the NMCC, the order is sent. -> it is also sent to the Alternate National Military Command Center (ANMCC) and to an airborne command post, either the presidental National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) onboard the AACP (E-4B) or to ABNCP (Operation Looking Glass, the E-6B). If the NMCC is destroyed in a first strike, either the ANMCC, NAOC, or ABNCP can issue the orders to execute the SIOP. -> the senior NMCC officer prepares an Emergency War Order (EWO) which contains the war plan, time to launch, and authentication codes with a second officer validating. -> the order is broadcast to each worldwide command and directly to launch crews through an encrypted EAM. -> as the EAM reaches the nuclear delivery platforms, most modern weapons require codes for Permissive Action Links (PAL). This circuitry inside the weapon is such that it cannot be reached without disabling the weapon. Most weapons have additional arming circuitry so that even if a valid code is entered, willnot arm the warhead unless the weapon knows it has been released on an expected delivery path (acceleration, zero-g coasting, aspects of hypersonic re-entry). -> decimation of the modern world.

### Cruise Missiles and Missile Guidance

Generally they consist of an airframe with a guidance system, payload, propulsion system, small wings, and an empennage for flight control. Propulsion tends to be a jet engine with turbofan. The guidance systems consist of a radar altimeter, barometric altimeter and clock to navigate a digital strip map. More advanced systems use inertial guidance, satellite guidance, and terrain contour matching (TERCOM). TERCOM uses a pre-recorded terrain contour map that is compared with measurements made during flight by an onboard radar altimeter. Radar altimeters measure the altitude by timing radio waves that travel from beneath an aircraft to the ground and reflect back. By flying at low altitudes, it is harder to detect using ground based radar.

Missile guidance systems have the goal of improving the Probability of Guidance (Pg). They are divided into two categories: Go-Onto-Target (GOT) and Go-Onto-Location-In-Space (GOLIS). The former targets either a moving or fixed target, whereas the latter is limited to stationary or near stationary targets. GOT systems can be divided into three subsystems: target tracker, missile tracker, and guidance computer. These can either be remote control guidance (guidance and target tracker on the launcher) or homing guidance (guidance and tracker is on the missile).

### Communicating with Submarines

Radio waves do not travel well through salt water, as such submerged submarines are cut off from radio contact with ordinary frequencies. They can surface, but then they are at danger to anti-submarine warfare. Very low frequency (VLF) radio waves (3-30 kHz, 100-10 km wavelength) can penetrate a few hundred feet of seawater. Extremely low frequency (ELF) radio waves (3-30 Hz, 100,000 to 10,000 km wavelength) can penetrate seawater at submarine operating depths, but require large antennas. 

For submarines at depth, they can deploy a buoy to communicate over VLF to a few meters below the surface but this is not a long term solution. Submarines also struggle to transmit VLF due to the large transmitter power requirement and large antenna surface area, however they can receive. To transmit the submarine must surface and transmit over HF. Because of the narrow bandwidths available, voice transmission is impossible. VLF data transmission rates are around 300bit/s.

ELF transmitter stations are difficult to construct, as even with a half-wavelength dipole antenna for a several thousand kilometer wavelength, it is incredibly large. The solution is to bury two large electrodes in the ground and different sites in an area with low ground conductivity, then feed lines from them to a station in the middle with a distance of several tens of kilometers. Its transmission can be received virtually anywhere.
