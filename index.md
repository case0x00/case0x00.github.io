i am case.

i am passionate about robotics. [here](https://github.com/onlycase) is my github.

i recently obtained my bachelors in aerospace engineering in the UK.

## goals

this can be split into three pillars: advanced robotics, BCI, and AGI. the remaining items in the list fit into these categories, but also deserved their own point.

* <details><summary> advanced robotics, particularly bio-inspired lifelike robotics, near indistinguishable from their biological counterparts </summary>
  <pre>
  this would be the pinnacle of robotics, and although this technology features heavily in dystopian worlds like in 'do androids dream of electric sheep, 'blade runner', and 'westworld' i think those are heavily pessimistic views. L5 autonomous vehicles technically fits into this robotics category.
  </pre>
  </details>

* <details><summary> cheap and ubiquitous brain-computer interfaces </summary>
  <pre>
  there is an incredible bottleneck in communication bandwidth in the form of the human sensory organs. bypassing these, and interfacing directly to the brain would be an evolutionary leap for humanity. in the process, we will learn a great amount of how the brain works, solving many mysteries, and saving countless lives.
  </pre>
  </details>


* <details><summary> artificial general intelligence</summary>
  <pre>
  what is there to say? this would be the pinnacle of all human creation -- creating an artificial human-level intelligence. one of the most, if not the most, challenging problems the world may ever see. i will write a blog post about this at some point.  
  </pre>
  </details>

* <details><summary> L5 autonomous vehicles </summary>
  <pre>
  autonomous vehicles are the best current implementation for an artificial intelligence and i believe work here can contribute towards AGI. furthermore, and more interestingly for most people, an enormous amount of time is wasted driving. it just makes sense to optimize the driving process.
  </pre>
  </details>

* <details>
  <summary> exploration of our solar system and beyond </summary>
  <pre>
  we have already made great strides in discovering more about our solar system, but there is much more to learn. human missions arean obvious step, but i think robotics are more fit for this role. a caveat to this point is that i think far more exploration must also be done here on earth, in our oceans. there is still a lot to learn about our own world.
  </pre>

## interests

this is partially an extension of my goals, but has more specificity and includes some unrelated interests.

* robotics
    - UAVs
    - bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion
    - autonomous vehicles
    - spacecraft GNC

* AI/ML
    - AGI
    - reinforcement learning, primarily for robotics
    - computer vision, primarily for robotics perception

* security
    - web security
    - hardware reverse engineering

* software
    - operating systems development
    - graphics

* worldbuilding
    - i like building fictional worlds similar to tolkein, herbert, pratchett, asimov, etc.


## experience

i worked for a summer at the university of york's space robotics and autonomous systems lab where i designed and built a rover with a tensegrity spine structure with bio-inspired control (i definitely want to work more with tensegrity structures). during my undergraduate i worked on a variety of design teams, building and flying UAVs and rockets. i also build robots in my spare time.

i will attach my resume here at some point but [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-case-cutler-b59375162/) is my linkedin.

## languages

* english
* some korean, spanish, rusisan, japanese, french

## projects

[here](https://onlycase.github.io/tags/projects/) is a link to all my project related blog posts. i am only just getting it started. 

## worldbuilding

[here](https://onlycase.github.io/tags/worldbuilding/) is a link to all my worldbuilding related blog posts. all of my resources are scattered, from paper and notebooks to files on the cloud and hard drives so i am trying to coalesce them. these posts primarily focus on my most recent world/mythos, which usually contains fragments of older worlds but i may add separate posts for older worlds one day.
