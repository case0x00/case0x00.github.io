i am case.

i am passionate about robotics and space. [here](https://github.com/onlycase) is my github. although, i have many other interests.

i recently obtained my bachelors in aerospace engineering in the UK.

## goals

this can be split into four pillars: advanced robotics, space exploration, BCI, and AGI. 

* <details><summary> advanced robotics </summary>
  <i>
  this includes autonomous vehicles, bio-robotics/bipedals/quadrupedals, and technically space robotics. these systems have the ability to completely change how humans work and operate in our environment. the challenges are in both software and hardware, and i believe some companies are taking the right approach to solving these problems.
  </i>
  </details>

* <details><summary> space exploration </summary>
  <i>
  we have already made great strides in discovering more about our solar system, but there is much more to learn. human missions are an obvious step, but i think robotics are more fit for this role. I believe all of the other pillars of interest here essentially lead to space exploration and settling of other worlds. this is my primary calling.

* <details><summary> brain-computer interfaces </summary>
  <i>
  there is an incredible bottleneck in communication bandwidth in the form of the human sensory organs. bypassing these, and interfacing directly to the brain would be an evolutionary leap for humanity. in the process, we will learn a great amount of how the brain works, solving many mysteries, and saving countless lives. this can also be paired with AR/VR.

* <details><summary> artificial general intelligence</summary>
  <i>
  what is there to say? this would be the pinnacle of all human creation -- creating an artificial human-level intelligence. one of the most, if not the most, challenging problems the world may ever see. i will write a blog post about this at some point. afaik no one at present is tackling this problem properly.

## interests

this is partially an extension of my goals, but has more specificity and includes some unrelated interests.

* space
    - launch vehicle GNC and design
    - spacecraft AOCS/GNC and design
    - space robotics autonomy and design
    - spacecraft propulsion
    - astrophysics

* robotics
    - UAVs
    - bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion
    - autonomous vehicles
    - perception, primarily computer vision
    - reinforcement learning

* AI
    - AGI software/hardware/wetware
    - BCI as an interface to an AGI

* security
    - web security
    - hardware reverse engineering

* software
    - operating systems development
    - graphics

* misc
    - VR as i think it has incredible potential for escapism

* worldbuilding
    - i like building fictional worlds similar to tolkein, herbert, pratchett, asimov, etc.


## experience

i worked for a summer at the university of york's space robotics and autonomous systems lab where i designed and built a rover with a tensegrity spine structure with bio-inspired control (i definitely want to work more with tensegrity structures). during my undergraduate i worked on a variety of design teams, building and flying UAVs and rockets. i also build robots in my spare time.

i will attach my resume here at some point but [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-case-cutler-b59375162/) is my linkedin.

## languages

* english
* some korean, spanish, russian, japanese, french

## projects

[here](https://onlycase.github.io/tags/projects/) is a link to all my project related blog posts. i am only just getting it started. 

## worldbuilding

[here](https://onlycase.github.io/tags/worldbuilding/) is a link to all my worldbuilding related blog posts. all of my resources are scattered, from paper and notebooks to files on the cloud and hard drives so i am trying to coalesce them. these posts primarily focus on my most recent world/mythos, which usually contains fragments of older worlds but i may add separate posts for older worlds one day.
