i am case.

i recently obtained my bachelors in aerospace engineering in the UK.

## life goals

* bio-inspired, lifelike robotics, near indistinguishable from their biological counterparts
* cheap brain-computer interfaces
* L5 autonomous vehicles
* artificial general intelligence
* exploration of our solar system (and beyond)


## interests

* robotics
    - UAVs
    - bipedal/etc locomotion
    - autonomous vehicles
    - spacecraft GNC
    - brain computer interfaces

* AI/ML
    - AGI
    - RL
    - CV

* security
    - web security and bug bounties
    - hardware reverse engineering

* software
    - operating systems development
    - graphics 


## experience

i did a summer at the university of york's space robotics and autonomous systems lab. i designed and worked on a rover with a tensegrity spine structure with bio-inspired control. during my undergraduate i worked on a variety of design teams, building UAVs and rockets. i also build robots in my spare time. my [github](https://github.com/onlycase) has some projects, but like most i have a billion things in the works.

## languages

* english
* some korean
* some spanish
* some russian
* some japanese
* some french

## hobbies

i love cyberpunk. i also enjoy [worldbuilding](https://onlycase.github.io/worldbuilding/).


## coursework/classes

* Underactuated Robotics by Russ Tedrake
* Berkeley's CS287: Advanced Robotics by Pieter Abbeel
* Programming for Robotics - ROS (ETH)

undergraduate
