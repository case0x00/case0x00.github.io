<h1> briefly about me </h1>

<p>
my legal name is thomas cutler but I prefer to go by my shortened handle, case. I am an engineer and a hacker and I recently obtained my bachelors in aerospace engineering. my interests include

<ul>
    <li>space exploration</li>
    <ul>
        <li>interplanetary mission design</li>
        <li>space habitat design</li>
        <li>spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control</li>
        <li>space robotics</li>
    </ul>
    <li>security</li>
    <ul>
        <li>reverse engineering and binary exploitation</li>
        <li>bug bounties/web security</li>
        <li>CTFs</li>
        <li>opsec</li>
        <li>osint</li>
    </ul>
    <li>strategy</li>
    <ul>
        <li>national security strategy</li>
        <li>asymmetrical warfare</li>
        <li>irregular warfare (sabotage, insurgency/counter-insurgency)</li>
        <li>space warfare and policy</li>
        <li>military history</li>
    </ul>
    <li>weaponry</li>
    <ul>
        <li>fire control systems</li>
        <li>missile guidance</li>
        <li>military aircraft, naval vessels</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
</p>

<h1> goals </h1>
<p>
ultimately, I want to continue to push for space exploration and establish myriad research stations within our solar system, with permanent inhabitants. I think we can achieve human landings on mars by 2035-2040 and a permanent research outpost by 2060. however, I think focusing on planets/moons too much is a mistake and we should focus on developing space habitats and asteroid redirect technology.
</p>

<p>
AGI is another critical area to pursue. I think this is more time sensitive because of a soon-to-be arms race, and whoever reaches it first will hold incredible power. AGI should be completed by 2047 (pm 27yrs), or at least there will be such a large phase transition it will drive GWP to infinity which is either assumed to be the creation of AGI, or ASI, or maybe some kind of unique implementation of such a system to a certain field. this ties into national security and cybersecurity.
</p>

<p>
finally, BCIs would be an incredible technology. human sensory organs are a large communication bandwidth bottleneck, and once it can be bypassed I think that would be the next stage in human evolution. this combined with a sort of human-AGI merging will be the ultimate step in human evolution. again, this tech is pretty far off and is on the backburner for now.
