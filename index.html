<h1> briefly about me </h1>

<p>
my legal name is thomas cutler but i prefer to go by my shortened handle, case. i recently obtained my bachelors in aerospace engineering and am looking to pursue a PhD in the united states or get into industry. my research interests include:
<ul>
    <li>low-thrust interplanetary mission design</li>
    <li>spacecraft and rocket guidance, navigation, and control</li>
    <li>robotics autonomy</li>
    <li>cybersecurity, national security, and defense</li>
</ul>

i am also a hacker, enjoying web-based bug bounties, CTFs, reverse engineering, and binary exploitation.
</p>

<h1> goals </h1>
<p>
ultimately, i want to continue to push for space exploration and establish countless research stations within our solar system, with permanent inhabitants. i think we can achieve human landings on mars by 2035-2040 and a permanent research outpost by 2060. however, i think focusing on planets/moons too much is a mistake and we should focus on developing space habitats and asteroid redirect technology.
</p>

<p>
AGI is another critical area to pursue. i think this is more time sensitive because of a soon-to-be arms race, and whoever reaches it first will hold incredible power. AGI should be completed by 2047 (pm 27yrs), or at least there will be such a large phase transition it will drive GWP to infinity which is either assumed to be the creation of AGI, or ASI, or maybe some kind of unique implementation of such a system to a certain field. this ties into national security and cybersecurity.
</p>

<p>
finally, BCIs would really be the final step in the cyberpunk reality. human sensory organs are a large communication bandwidth bottleneck, and once it can be bypassed i think that would be the next stage in human evolution. this combined with a sort of human-AGI merging will be the ultimate step in human evolution. again, this tech is pretty far off and something i cannot focus on right now.
