note: im not a web developer but i am tired of most website's design. this website features information about me, details of my past, present, and maybe future projects, random notes, and worldbuilding notes. i also like lowercase, since this is all informal.
</p>

<h1> briefly about me </h1>

<p>
my legal name is thomas cutler but i prefer to go by my shortened handle, case. i recently obtained my bachelors in aerospace engineering, and am looking to pursue a PhD in the united states at some point in the future with my research interests focusing on interplanetary mission design, spacecraft/rocket GNC, robotics autonomy, and EDL systems. i am also a hacker, enjoying web-based bug bounties, reverse engineering, and binary exploitation.
</p>

<p>
ultimately, i want to continue to push for the exploration of other worlds and establish countless research stations within our solar system, with permanent inhabitants. i think we can achieve human landings on mars by 2035-2040 and a permanent research outpost by 2060. it will take far longer to establish a larger, permanent town and even longer to be fully independent from earth. mars is not the only target, obviously, but it is the logical next step. i hope these efforts do help us realize how precious and unique earth is, and we wont ever get anything better than it.
</p>
<h1> goals </h1>
<p>
beyond space exploration, i want to pursue bipedal and more general-purpose robotics -- these can be both helpful off-world and on earth. these are challening in many ways, but i dont want to focus too hard on them just yet.
</p>

<p>
AGI is another critical area to pursue. i think this is more time sensitive because of a soon-to-be arms race, and whoever reaches it first will hold incredible power. AGI should be completed by 2047 (pm 27yrs), or at least there will be such a large phase transition it will drive GWP to infinity which is either assumed to be the creation of AGI, or ASI, or maybe some kind of unique implementation of such a system to a certain field.
</p>

<p>
finally, BCIs would really be the final step in the cyberpunk reality. human sensory organs are a large communication bandwidth bottleneck, and once it can be bypassed i think that would be the next stage in human evolution. this combined with a sort of human-AGI merging will be the ultimate step in human evolution. again, this tech is pretty far off and something i cannot focus on right now.
