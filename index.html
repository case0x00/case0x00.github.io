<h1> current status </h1>
<p></p>
I am currently:
<ul>
    <li>trying to get into a PhD program</li>
    <li>learning korean, russian, spanish, and latin</li>
    <li>playing a lot of chess</li>

<h1> briefly about me </h1>

<p>
my legal name is thomas cutler but I prefer to go by my shortened handle, case. I am an engineer and a hacker and I recently obtained my bachelors in aerospace engineering. admittedly, the name case came from the 1984 novel neuromancer: the character is a "console cowboy" and a brilliant hacker. that is one of my favorite novels, gibson is one of my favorite authors, and I love cyberpunk. my other interests include

<ul>
    <li>space exploration</li>
    <ul>
        <li>interplanetary mission design</li>
        <li>space robotics</li>
        <li>spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control</li>
        <li>space habitat design</li>
    </ul>
    <li>security and hacking</li>
    <ul>
        <li>reverse engineering and binary exploitation</li>
        <li>bug bounties/web security</li>
        <li>CTFs</li>
        <li>opsec</li>
        <li>osint</li>
    </ul>
    <li>strategy</li>
    <ul>
        <li>national security strategy</li>
        <li>asymmetrical warfare</li>
        <li>irregular warfare (sabotage, insurgency/counter-insurgency)</li>
        <li>space warfare and policy</li>
        <li>military (and world) history</li>
    </ul>
    <li>weaponry</li>
    <ul>
        <li>fire control systems</li>
        <li>missile guidance</li>
        <li>military aircraft, naval vessels</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h1> goals </h1>

<p>
in my lifetime there are three areas I want to pursue which should result in me probably running 2-3 companies. these areas are space exploration, cyberware, and AGI.
</p>

<p>
I intend to ardently push for greater exploration of space with the goals of harvesting resources from asteroids and comets, and establishing research stations on the surface and in orbit of various planets, moons, and other small bodies. I think the obsession with landing on mars now is akin to the apollo program and may result in further stagnation, as people are not investing in technology or ideas beyond landings. furthermore, I also believe the obsession with the idea of living on other planets is misguided and people should focus more on space habitats (although significantly more research must be done on both arguments to verify which is truly optimal). a preliminary stage would be to start orbital manufacturing. asteroids should provide what is necessary to fund my other ventures, or maybe there are untapped space industries which are still unknown.
</p>

<p>
cyberware, which primarily encompasses prosthetics and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), are an inevitable technology that would better the lives of everybody and allow for humanity to evolve beyond our current meat bags. this initially would allow patients who have suffered severe body trauma to function as they would pre-trauma, and would eventually lead to solving myriad kinds of ailments and finally to optimizing people for their environment or career. this is essentially rapid evolution. for example reinforced bones for workers lifting or carrying heavy items, modified vision for pilots, or air filters in the lungs to assist those in high pollution environments. BCIs would allow communication channels to bypass the natural bandwidth bottlenecks in human sensory organs input and prehensile appendage control. my interest in security would tie into this, as ensuring these connections are secure and any cyberware modifications are safe is paramount. we already live in a somewhat symbiotic relationship with technology, particularly cellphones, and the near constant ability to locate knowledge and communicate has changed the world and increased our quality of life. this is just the next step in.
</p>

<p>
finally, AGI is another critical area to pursue. I think this is more time sensitive because of a soon-to-be arms race, and whoever reaches it first will hold incredible power. AGI will likely be completed by 2050, or at least there will be such a large phase transition it will drive GWP to infinity which is either assumed to be the creation of AGI, or ASI, or maybe some kind of unique implementation of such a system to a certain field. this ties into national security, cybersecurity, and to cyberware.
