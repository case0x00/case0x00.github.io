<h1>about me</h1>

<p>my nickname/alias is case, though my legal name is thomas cutler.</p>

<p>I am an engineer and a hacker. I recently obtained my bachelors in aerospace engineering. the name case came from the 1984 novel neuromancer where the character is a "console cowboy" and a brilliant hacker.</p>

<p>my research interests are (space) robotics and optimal control, (low thrust) interplanetary trajectory design, hacking and reverse engineering, AI, and BCI/cyberware.</p>

<h1> goals </h1>

<p>in my lifetime there are three areas which I want to pursue: space exploration, robotics and cyberware, and AGI.</p>

<ul>
<li>
    my goal for space exploration is to harvest the myriad resources available in space from asteroids and comets primarily, and to establish research stations on the surface on and in orbit of various planets, moons, and other small bodies. by the end of the century these stations should have permanent inhabitants, with maybe 100,000+ people regularly living in space either in orbits or on the surface.
</li>
<br>
<li>
    robotics development will greatly enhance the ability to carry out the goals stated in the prior point. advanced robotics should alleviate the necessity for people to perform dangerous jobs, as well as making people's lives infinitely easier in industrial, domestic, and other areas. people's vision of the future for the past 100 years has always contained an abundance of robots and other similar systems, and its high time we realize that future as our reality. cyberware encompasses brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and advanced prosthetics. this initially would allow patients who have suffered severe body trauma to function as they would pre-trauma, and BCIs would allow communication channels to bypass the natural bandwidth bottlenecks in human sensory organs input and prehensile appendage control as the next stage in evolution.
</li>
<br>
<li>
    AGI/ASI is another critical area to pursue and ties into the second point. I think fears are misguided, since if we are able to merge humans and AGI/ASI through cyberware as a kind of symbiotic relationship then we can both benefit. this one is definitely more time critical given the national security implications, however I think a realistic reality is one whereby there are dozens (or hundreds) of AGI/ASI agents rather than a monolithic one at the mercy of whatever nation creates it. this should be achieved around 2050.

</ul>
