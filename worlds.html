usually i have several worlds in the works: a junji ito/lovecraft-inspired world centered around a small island and a lighthouse, a hard sci-fi pan-galactic epic, a waterworld-inspired ocean world with pirates and colossal sea creatures, some fantasy world with multiple dimensional planes, random constructed languages that dont quite fit any world yet, and some notebooks full of drawings.


<h1> (more distinct) worlds </h1>
<h2><a href="worlds/monsoon.html">monsoon</a></h2>

i recently watched prospect (2018) and its a highly immersive world; the designs of the ships, the designs of the space suits and the reason why they are even on that world are such intriguing concepts. it got me thinking about space westerns, the frontier in space, and exploring the unknown in its purest form. i think this is what i want monsoon to be. that idea is really the reason why i got into aerospace engineering in the first place -- exploring the unknown.
