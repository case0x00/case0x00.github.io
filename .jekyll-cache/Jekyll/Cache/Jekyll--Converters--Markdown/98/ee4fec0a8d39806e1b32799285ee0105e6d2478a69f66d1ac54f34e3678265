<p>i am case. i am passionate about robotics and space, and i am a hacker. <a href="https://github.com/onlycase">here</a> is my github. it is my goal to push humanity both to the stars and to evolve beyond what we today consider human.</p>

<p>i recently obtained my bachelors in aerospace engineering in the UK, and am looking to pursue a PhD in aerospace engineering or robotics in the united states at some point in the future with my research interests focusing on autonomous systems in uncertain environments. this is applied to both terrestrial vehicles and spacecraft.</p>

<p><a href="https://onlycase.github.io/tags/projects/">here</a> is a link to all my project related blog posts. i am only just getting it started.</p>

<p><a href="https://onlycase.github.io/tags/notes/">here</a> is a link to all my notes related blog posts. these are just random thoughts or short research topics that i am storing for personal use.</p>

<p><a href="https://onlycase.github.io/tags/worldbuilding/">here</a> is a link to all my worldbuilding related blog posts. all of my resources are scattered, from paper and notebooks to files on the cloud and hard drives so i am trying to coalesce them. these posts primarily focus on my most recent world/mythos, which usually contains fragments of older worlds but i may add separate posts for older worlds one day.</p>

<h2 id="goals">goals</h2>

<p>my goals can be split into four pillars:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <details><summary> advanced robotics </summary>
<i>
this includes autonomous vehicles, bio-robotics/bipedals/quadrupedals, and technically space robotics. these systems have the ability to completely change how humans work and operate in our environment. the challenges are in both software and hardware, and i believe some companies are taking the right approach to solving these problems.
</i>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details><summary> space exploration </summary>
<i>
we have already made great strides in discovering more about our solar system, but there is much more to learn. human missions are an obvious step, but i think robotics are more appropriate for this role. I believe all of the other pillars of interest here essentially lead to space exploration and settling of other worlds. this is my primary calling.
</i>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details><summary> brain-computer interfaces </summary>
<i>
there is an incredible bottleneck in communication bandwidth in the form of the human sensory organs. bypassing these, and interfacing directly to the brain would be an evolutionary leap for humanity. in the process, we will learn a great amount of how the brain works, solving many mysteries, and saving countless lives. this can also be paired with AR/VR.
</i>
</details>
  </li>
  <li>
    <details><summary> artificial general intelligence</summary>
<i>
what is there to say? this would be the pinnacle of all human creation -- creating an artificial human-level intelligence. one of the most, if not the most, challenging problems the world may ever see. i will write a blog post about this at some point. afaik no one at present is tackling this problem properly.

  </li>
</ul>

<p>within robotics, my interests can be further divided into:</p>
<ul>
  <li>UAVs</li>
  <li>bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion</li>
  <li>autonomous vehicles</li>
  <li>perception</li>
</ul>

<p>and within space, my interests can be further divied into:</p>
<ul>
  <li>launch vehicle GNC and design</li>
  <li>spacecraft AOCS/GNC and design</li>
  <li>space robotics autonomy and design</li>
  <li>space mission design</li>
  <li>spacecraft propulsion</li>
  <li>astrophysics</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="languages">languages</h2>

<ul>
  <li>english</li>
  <li>some korean, spanish, russian, japanese, french</li>
</ul>

<p>i would like to become fluent in all of these.</p>
