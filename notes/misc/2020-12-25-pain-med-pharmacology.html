<h1>on the pharmacology of codeine and ibuprofen</h1>

<p>
I was having some pain from my impacted wisdom tooth, so I took some nurofen plus (ibuprofen + codeine) and was curious how it worked. nurofen plus contains 12.8mg of codeine phosphate and 200mg of ibuprofen.
</p>

<p>
as a tl;dr, codeine is converted to morphine in the liver which binds to opioid receptors, inhibiting the release of pain neurotransmitters. ibuprofen inhibits COX-2 enzymes, which inhibits production of compounds which cause inflammation and pain.
</p>
<p>
codeine (3-methylmorphine) is classed as an opiate (classically, as being naturally derived) or opioid (modern, as being both naturally and synthetically created) which means when naturally derived it is done so from opium, the dried latex obtained from the seed capsules of the Papaver somniferum variant album. somniferum meaning sleep-bringing, referring to the sedative properties of some of the opiates. coincidentally, poppy seeds are derived from the same poppy. other opiates include morphine, thebaine, oripavine, papaverine, and noscapine. codeine can be extracted directly from opium, however most is synthesized from morphine through O-methylation. methylation means the addition of a methyl group on a substrate or the substitution of an atom/group by a methyl group. the modern classification, opioids, refers to any substance that binds to opioid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems, and the gastrointestinal tract. these receptors positively and negatively regulate synaptic transmission through downstream signalling. there are four major subtypes of opioid receptors: \(\delta\) (DOR), \(\kappa\) (KOR), \(\mu\) (MOR), and nociceptin (NOR) opiod receptors. codeine is a selective agonist of the MOR with a relatively weak affinity for it. agonists are chemicals that bind to a receptor and activate it to produce a biological response. contrasted to antagonists which block the action of an agonist. codeine is metabolised in the liver by the enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) into morphine, which is 10x more potent against the MOR. the CYP2D6 is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics (not naturally produced as xenos meaning foreign) in the body, responsible for the metabolism and elimination of some clinically used drugs and the activation of some prodrugs (medication metabolized into an active drug after administration). after codeine is converted into morphine in the liver, it undergoes glucuronidation which produces glucuronides which are typically more water-soluable than non-glucuronic acid-containing substances. these active metabolites are excreted by the kidneys and bind to the MOR, resulting in a hyperpolarization of the neuron leading to the inhibition of release of nociceptive neurotransmitters, creating an increased pain tolerance due to reduced neuronal excitability. nociception is the sensory nervous system's process of encoding pain stimuli, with nociceptors producing the signal that travels along nerve fibers via the spinal cord to the brain.
</p>
<p>
overdoses occur by over-activating the four major subtypes of opioid receptors which can cause permanent brain damage from cerebral hypoxia or neurotoxicity. MORs and KORs have an analgesic effect on the brain, but the MORs are the source of addiction and KORs contribute to the continued abuse of opioids. they generate dysphoria in the response to increasing stress levels during withdrawal. prolonged exposure to opioids can internalize the receptors, leading to increased tolerance and increased use.
</p>
<p>
ibuprofen is an NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug). it works by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes which convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin \(\text{H}_2\) (\(\text{PGH}_2\)). the inhibition of COX-2 decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved ininflammation, pain, and swelling

pretty fucking cool all of that is packed into a tiny tablet.
