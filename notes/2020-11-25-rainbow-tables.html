<h1> rainbow tables </h1>

<p>
rainbow tables are tables of pre-computed hash values pre-matched to plaintext passwords. hashing is important as when passwords are used in a system, they are passed through a 1-way encryption function (the hash function) before being sent through communication channels to ensure no eavesdroppers can read the password. this is assuming the hashing algorithm itself is insecure (i.e. not SHA-1 for example). the system is able to verify the password is correct by passing the actual password through the same hashing function and comparing the result.
</p>

<p>traditional brute forcing can use a method called a dictionary attack. this encrypts potential passwords from a wordlist using the same hash function as the target unknown password and repeatedly tests this against the system.</p>


<p>hashing functions map plaintext to hashes, but a reduction function maps a hash to plaintext (though it is not an inverse hash function). applying a hashing function to some plaintext x will yield some hash y, but applying a reduction function to this hash y will yield some different plaintext z which can be in no way related to x. </p>

<p>rainbow tables contain chains of hash and reduction functions starting at a certain plaintext and ending in a certain hash. it starts with some plaintext, hashes it, reduces it, hashes the new plaintext, etc. the reason these tables can be preferable to dictionaries is all that is stored is the initial plaintext and the final hash which manages to encode a chain of thousands or millions of hashes. the goal of password cracking is, knowing some password hash, to discover the corresponding plaintext (the password). </p>

<p>to use rainbow tables, the algorithm looks for the password hash in the list of final hashes. if it isnt there, it reduces the password hash to another plaintext, hashes that plaintext, and checks for that hash against the list of final hashes. it continues this loop until the hash matches one of the final hashes, which means the chain at some point contains the original hash. at this point, take the original starting plaintext and hash and reduce until the password hash is found and withit the password plaintext.</p>

<p>a collision is when a given hash may be generated by multiple plaintexts, which is a major security concern for hashing functions. two different passwords, with the same hash, could be used to verify an account for example. for rainbow tables this means chains with different initial plaintexts could converge.</p>
