personal site


navbar -- about | posts | worldbuilding

home page -- about me
posts -- links to posts tagged with #projects
worldbuilding -- links to posts tagged with #world





tags/index.html -- page for all posts with all tags

in my case
tags/projects/index.html -- page for project tags
tags/worldbuilding/index.html -- page for worldbuilding tags


for each post in \_posts, has a tag

/\_layouts/tagpage.html -> pulls tag from variable 'tag' in YAML front-matter, loops all posts with that tag
